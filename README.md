# qol-bash
Quality of life bash scripts that automate some regular workflow tasks.

## Tmux Workspace
This bash script creates a tmux session in the directory of your choice, 
opens a new window, and starts nvim. In one window, we can edit code. In 
the other, we can run a local server, perform git commands, or other 
CLI commands.

In tmux-worspace.sh, you'll want to replace the path to the setup-nvim-workspace.sh file to the absolute path in your file system.
